    "## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PPO algorithm was introduced by the OpenAI team in 2017 and quickly became one of the most popular RL methods surpassing the Deep-Q learning method. It involves collecting a small batch of experiences interacting with the environment and using that batch to update its decision-making policy. Once the policy is updated with this batch, the experiences are thrown away and a newer batch is collected with the newly updated policy. This is the reason why it is an “on-policy learning” approach where the experience samples collected are only useful for updating the current policy once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key contribution of PPO is ensuring that a new update of the policy does not change it too much from the previous policy. This leads to less variance in training at the cost of some bias, but ensures smoother training and also makes sure the agent does not go down an unrecoverable path of taking senseless actions."

PPO tries to address this by only making small updates to the model in an update step, thereby stabilizing the training process. The PPO loss can be calculated as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "(Why? Because PPO uses a stochastic policy (i.e. a conditional probability distribution of actions given states) and the policy's objective function is based on sampling from trajectories from a probability distribution that depends the current policy's probability distribution (i.e. you need to use the current policy to generate the trajectories). NOTE that this is true for any policy gradients approach using a stochastic policy, not just PPO.)\n",

    "\n",

Because DDPG/TD3 use a deterministic policy and Silver, David, et al. \"Deterministic policy gradient algorithms.\" 2014. proved that the policy's objective function is an expectation value of state trajectories from the Markov Decision Process state transition function...but does not depend on the probability distribution induced by the policy, which after all is deterministic not stochastic.)"

You'll spend less wall-clock time training a PPO-like algorithm in a cheap environment.\n",

    "If you need to decide between DDPG and SAC, choose TD3. The performance of SAC and DDPG is nearly identical when you compare on the basis of whether or not a twin delayed update is used. SAC can be troublesome to get working, and the temperature parameter controls the stochasticity of your final policy -- effectively, it means your reward scheme can give you a policy that is too random to be useful, and picking a temperature parameter isn't necessarily straightforward. TD3 is almost the same as SAC, but noise injection is often easier to visualize and tune than setting the right temperature parameter."

During each trajectory roll-out, we save all the experience tuples (state, action, reward, next_state) and store them in a finite-sized cache — a “replay buffer.” Then, we sample random mini-batches of experience from the replay buffer when we update the value and policy networks.\n",

This fails to be the case when we optimize a sequential decision process in an on-policy way, because the data then would not be independent of each other.

    "One ability humans have is to learn from our mistakes and adjust next time to avoid making the same mistake. We can apply the same concept to our reinforcement learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this time, instead of concluding that the course of action you took was useless because you didn’t score a goal, what if you say that maybe it didn’t teach you how to score a goal, but it certainly taught you how NOT to shoot the puck. Or more precisely, what if you say it taught you how to shoot the puck slightly to the right side of the net? Now you can learn not only how to shoot towards the right, but you learn something new that might help you achieve the final goal every run. This is the idea behind Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).\n",
    "\n",
    "The HER procedure looks like this:\n",
    "1. Run your policy and store everything you observe (state and goal, action, reward, next state and goal) tuple into an experience buffer.\n",
    "2. Sample K goals from the states visited in the episode obtained at step 1, and for each goal store (state and sampled goal, action, reward with respect to the sampled goal, next state and sampled goal) tuple into the buffer.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 1–2 N times.\n",
    "4. Sample M number of experience tuples (batch) from the buffer and train the network with the said batch experience. (Do this B times)\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this help? By adding goal into the input space we are stating that there are multiple goals for our agent to observe. The new Q-function indicates how good taking each action is, given the current state, to achieving the current goal. And because we are sampling the new goals from the episode, the goals are now nodes that have been visited by our agent. So even if our agent fails to achieve the main goal in this episode, it has reached some states. By using those states as the new goal, now the agent can be trained with positive (or non negative) rewards."
